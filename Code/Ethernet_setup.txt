INTRODUCTION.

    This is the Keil C51 compiler/ 8051 microcontroller port of Adam Dunkels'
    uIP TCP/IP stack v0.9.

    This file describes how to setup the uIP web server application to 
    communicate with a PC's network card using TCP/IP protocols. Upon 
    completion you will be able to retrieve a number of test pages from a 
    network card equipped, 8051 based server using a web browser.



COMPILING.

    First off, download the latest version of the uIP TCP/IP stack. It has 
    lots of other network applications, and has all the tools you will need to
    develop your own web content. In addition, the original distribution has
    very good documentation that will clear up any points about how uIP works,
    and help you to understand the methodology employed in it's design.

                           http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/

    The Ethernet port project file's configuration is for an Atmel T89C51AC2,
    single chip microcontroller with an 18.432 MHz Xtal. Change the controller
    type and crystal frequency to suit your hardware, and also set ETH_CPU_XTAL
    to an appropriate value in the file etherdev.h. You may need to adjust
    ETH_DATA_PORT, ETH_ADDR_PORT & ETH_CTRL_PORT in the file etherdev.h to 
    match your 8051 port to RTL8019AS network card wiring scheme. Compile for
    the small memory model .... That's it! 



CABLING.

    If you will be connecting the uIP webserver's 8051 hardware via a router
    or hub, then an ordinary twisted pair ethernet cable may be used. However,
    to communicate directly with a PC via it's network card, you will need a 
    'cross over' 10baseT twisted pair cable.

NETWORK CARD WIRING.

    The ethernet driver in this release is for a Realtek RTL8019AS based 
    network interface card. Some effort was made to keep the driver more NE2000
    compatible than it need be for the Realtek controller. Despite this, it
    was found that some otherwise 100% NE2000 compatible NICs wouldn't work
    with the driver. You may find an NE2000 compatible NIC that will, but a
    safe bet is the RTL8019AS for which the driver was specifically written.
    
    Make note of the 8051 ports that have been assigned to the various data,
    addressing and control functions in the file etherdev.h. Either wire your 
    implementation accordingly, or adjust these defines to suit your hardware.


        #define ETH_DATA_PORT P0     // Adjust this to suit hardware.
        #define ETH_ADDR_PORT P2     // Adjust this to suit hardware.
        #define ETH_CTRL_PORT P3     // Adjust this to suit hardware.


    This is then the 8051 port to ISA 16 bit edge card (or controller chip pin)
    mapping.

    You will note that there are no interrupt signals present. That's because
    the driver employs network controller, communication status polling.

    Check that you have a large enough 5V supply. Network cards are quite power
    hungry, particularly before a 10baseT link is established and the 5v to 9v
    voltage converter for 10base2 is still switched on. Standard 1 Amp 7805's
    will need a reasonable heatsink.
 


WINDOWS SETUP.

    This is roughly how to set up a Windows computer to communicate with the 
    uIP webserver through an ethernet cable. The exact procedure will depend on
    your version of OS. 

    We assume that you already have a network interface card fixed inside your 
    PC, and that all drivers have been installed.


 1. Assign an ip address to the PC's network card .

    Press Start > Settings > Control Panel.
    Double click the "Network" icon.
    Highlight the "TCP/IP -> ?" network component for your NIC.
    Press "Properties".
    On the IP Address tab check "Specify an IP address".
    Enter 192.168.0.1 for the IP Address.
    Enter 255.255.255.0 for the Subnet Mask.
    Press "OK".
    Press "OK" again.


 2. Setup Internet Explorer to use the Ethernet link.

    Press Start > Settings > Control Panel.
    Double click "Internet Options".
    On the Connections tab check "Never dial a connection".
    Press "OK".


    You should be able to connect to the uIP web server via the network card
    by entering the address http://192.168.0.3, or any address you may have 
    the server adjusted to respond to. The server needs to be set for an
    ip address in the same domain as the client port. We have set this to the
    private, class C network address 192.168.0.1 here, so the corresponding 
    server ip addresses are between 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.254 with an 
    associated netmask of 255.255.255.0
